# Contributing

This document contains instructions for suggesting changes to 
QSEC-CALCULATORSERVICE using GitHub.

## Repo Organization

Below is a description of how this repository is organized.

* The [`Src`](Src) directory contains the source code.

Thus, pull requests will normally need to modify only files in the `Src`
directory.


## Organizing Your Changes

You should put unrelated changes in different branches, and submit them
separately.

Moreover, do not update or attempt to fix any code or comments that is not
directly related to the change you are currently working on. Providing unrelated
changes can cause bugs and can also introduce needless conflicts when merging.

## Suggesting Changes

To suggest the changes in one of your branches, create a [pull
request][github-pull-request] (aka PR) from your branch on GitHub. Do not forget to update the README.md file with your changes.

## Local Workflows

Start out by forking the repository using GitHub's UI. We suggest you work with feature 
branches for each feature you work on, this so that you can easily return to a feature 
you worked on if a pull-request is not directly accepted.
